			<h2>What are Dental Implants?</h2>

			<p>If you're considering this cosmetic dental surgery to fix broken teeth, or your dentist has informed you that you need a dental implant to replace rotting, rotten, or lost teeth, it's essential that you know exactly what they are and what they do before you decide whether or not to go ahead with the procedure.

			Dental implants are a prosthetic replacement for missing teeth, typically made out of titanium, and are affixed to your jaw bone to act as a tooth root for your replacement tooth or bridge. There are two different methods of dental implants, but more on those in a minute.

			These implants mimic your natural teeth and are the most stable and long-lasting option in cosmetic dentistry.

			While I know this can be a scary thing to think about, and the entire process may seem a bit overwhelming right now, I'll explain everything and answer all of the questions I know you must have. When you get to the bottom of this page, you'll feel confident and maybe even excited about getting a brand new smile.</p>

			<h3>Different Types of Dental Implants</h3>
			
			<p>There are two main types of dental implants: Endosteal and Subperiosteal. Depending on your specific jaw condition and tooth replacement needs, your dentist will recommend one of these options for your tooth replacement. If you have no idea what those words mean, that's okay! I'll explain both for you down below. </p>

			<h3>Endosteal Dental Implants</h3>

			<p><a href="#" class="link">Endosteal implants</a> are easily the most commonly used type of dental implant. These implants are affixed directly to your jaw bone and are shaped to resemble small screws. This type of dental implant is most likely what your dentist will recommend if you have optimal oral health. </p>

			<h3>Subperiosteal Dental Implants</h3>

			<p><a href="#" class="link">Subperiosteal implants</a>, on the other hand, are recommended for patients that do not have enough healthy jawbone for the Endosteal implant and cannot (or do not want) to undergo the necessary bone augmentation procedures that would make the Endosteal implant an option. These dental implants do not enter the bone like the Endosteal implants but instead, rest between your gum line and your jawbone. 
			With this type of implant, though, it's important to note that it will not last nearly as long as the Endosteal implant. Multiple procedures can make you Endosteal ready if you choose to go that route. If this is true for you, talk to your dentist about bone augmentation, a sinus lift, or a ridge expansion.</p>

			<h2>Pros and Cons of Dental Implants</h2>
			<p>Deciding whether dental implants are right for you is a huge decision that shouldn't be taken lightly. To make things a little bit easier for you, I've highlighted the best perks and the not so great aspects of dental implants so that you can make an educated and informed decision. </p>

			<h3>Pros</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p>1.  They're natural-looking. These implants will work wonders for your smile confidence. They look, feel, and function as a natural tooth does, AND they're super stable. Go ahead and eat an apple or corn-on-the-cob. These implants aren't budging. </p></li>
				<li><p>2.  No upkeep! You'll get a lifetime out of one implant, and they don't require any maintenance.</p></li>
				<li><p>3.  Implants are stand-alone units. They support themselves and won't put any strain on your other teeth!</p></li>
				<li><p>4.  Implants protect and preserve your jaw bone. How? By simulating natural bone growth! A missing tooth increases your risk of jawbone deterioration, but these implants will act as a regular tooth and protect your jaw from bone loss. </p></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Cons</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>1.  They're expensive. Dental implants are painfully costly and this is one of the biggest reasons why many people opt for other options.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>2.  Surgery. As with any surgery, there are risks involved. Since dental implants are replicating your tooth root and implant themselves in your jaw bone, the operation required has the potential to result in infection, nerve damage, and other damage to surrounding teeth or your jawbone itself. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>3.  It's a time-consuming process. Bone heals slowly, so you should expect the entire process to take between 3-6 months before you're chewing as normal again.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>How much do Dental Implants Cost?</h1>
			<p>Before we get to the numbers, there are a few factors that will influence how much your dental implant will cost. 
			First, your location plays a significant role in the cost of this procedure. Just like anything else, you'll pay higher prices if you live in a big city and your dentist has to charge higher rates to cover his overhead. 
			Second, the number of implants you need will drastically change the cost of your tooth replacement. 
			Third, your cost will change depending on your insurance. While most companies will not cover the cost of this so-called "cosmetic" surgery, some might. It is worth checking into just in case!
			<br> <br>
			Now, the moment you've been waiting for: the numbers!
			A single tooth implant will cost between $1500-$6000. The implant itself averages $1000-$3000, and that's not including the crown or abutment, which can run anywhere from $500-$3000. 
			So, a full set has the potential to cost up to $90,000, though you may be looking at closer to $30,000 depending on the factors mentioned earlier that determine the cost. Yikes, right?</p>

			<h1>FAQ </h1>
			<h2>Does a dental implant hurt?</h2>
			<p>Most patients report discomfort rather than pain after dental implant surgery. There are several pain-blocking options available to you post-surgery, including prescription medications and a block that stops the pain for 24 hours. You will be under anesthesia for the procedure, so you will not feel any pain from the actual implant process, though you may still experience slight discomfort from the IV needle as well as soreness for several days following the surgery. </p>
			
			<h3>Are dental implants safe?</h3>

			<p>In short, yes. Dental implant procedures are 98% effective for a life-long term and are considered a safe dental procedure when performed by a qualified and experienced expert. However, every surgery comes with risks, and this is a surgical procedure. These risks are minimal, though. </p>

			<h3>How do I take care of my dental implants?</h3>

			<p>While dental implants require minimal maintenance, there are a few <a href="#" class="link">rules of thumb to follow</a> that will ensure the success and longevity of your implant.</p>

			<ol class="additional">
				<li>
					<p>Use a soft-bristle toothbrush</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Brush daily</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Choose low-abrasive toothpaste to protect your implant</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Use an interdental brush to clean hard-to-reach places (nylon recommended)</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Use a dentist-recommended oral irrigator for optimal cleaning</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Floss daily using an implant-specific floss</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>How long do they last?</h3>
